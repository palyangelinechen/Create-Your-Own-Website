					<h2 class = "heading">The Original Series</h2>
					<p>The original Star Trek series focuses on the 23rd century adventures of Captain James T. Kirk and the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701), a powerful interstellar spacecraft dispatched by Earth-based Starfleet Command to explore the galaxy.  Kirk commands a crew of 430 men and women aboard his starship, which can travel at speeds surpassing the speed of light.  Kirk’s five-year mission—and his mandate from Starfleet—is to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

					<h2 class = "heading">The Next Generation</h2>
					<p>Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) focuses on the 24th century adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).  This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children.  This era’s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home.  Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they’d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring.  There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.  However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.</p>
